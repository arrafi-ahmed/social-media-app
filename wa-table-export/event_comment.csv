We arrived in time to get out and into Auckland to get our bikes arranged and a chance to explore the town, the Albert park and stop for a bite to eat in the marina water front area and relax.  Tomorrow we collect our camper and start the tour of New Zealand.....cant wait but must get some much needed sleep.",2023-11-16 14:37:45

31,200,38,"04.30 wide awake, not bad i guess head hit the pillow and out for the count at 21.30. Down for breakfast, so much to choose from but  a good breakfast before a busy day.

A beautiful start to the day, 07.30 and already 21  degrees.

Head off for the shuttle bus to drop us at the campervan hire only to find they don't go as far as this, taxi it is (at least this should be the last one we take....yes they are not the cheapest of transport! But hey we are on holiday!) 
After a little wait for the camper we finally got our tour before being left on our own. first impression, boy it's massive .. and with that we loaded the suitcases, securely of course and set off to pick up the bikes.  

Graham got the bikes on the bike rack, and we were off to start this 3 week adventure and first stop, which i have to say i'm very excited for....... Hobbiton.

Just over 2 hours journey, the drizzle started but a lovely scenic drive, we are loving seeing the art work road side, hard to take photos as moving but couple of pictures did get taken. 

Hobbiton you didn't disappoint, our tour guide Nathaniel was extremely funny and knowledgeable, boarded the coach that takes you the 10 mins across the working farm land to the hidden gem of hobbiton. Peter Jackson built and rebuilt hobbiton for the first 3 movies before finally realizing it needed to be permanent, before working with the owner of the farm and the New Zealand government to make this accessable for the public to enjoy. It felt very surreal walking around a site of films we've watched many times, and yes we will be watching them when we get home.  the rain stopped and started throughout but 2 hours later we headed to The Dragon Rest for a cider then it was time to head back to the coach :( 

After a spot of lunch in the cafe we headed off to find the recommended Pack 'n' Save supermarket to stock up on provision oh and some food.

First camp site is Blue Lake, Rotorua. Driving through the Redwoods- Whakarewarewa Forest was amazing to have then spectacular views of the lake from the site, sadly weather hasn't started as we would of liked so photos of the lake don't do it justice. 

Evening spent sorting out unpacking the cases and cooking our first meal. ",2023-11-18 11:25:12
32,201,38," First night sleeping in the campervan must say wasn't that bad,  it rained all night, but bit longer sleep...

This morning we were heading off to attend the Puarenga Park,  Rotorua Park run, 8am start unlike UK 9am start. 70 runners finished the race, Graham 28th parkrun first one at Puarenga Park sadly probably his only one, but as a sight seeing parkrun finished 16th. 3 people from the UK, couple we meet who were picking up there camper at the same time. 

The car park for this event was at the Te Karapu o Whakarewarewa Rugby Club, so would of been rude to just not stay after the race and use the car park for us to cook breakfast before heading off to the spa. 

Next stop on the itinerary is the Polynesian Spa, Rotorua. Anniversary treat, booked ourselves the Ultimate Double Dipper.  This was an experience, geothermal hot springs, this was just what was needed to refresh. such an experience each pool hotter than the the last from 36 degrees to 41 degrees. A well worth visit, followed by a free smoothie and maybe a spot of lunch.

The drive from the spa to our next campsite was another scenic route, sadly the rain masked much of the scenery, rolling hills and its all very green land. The many forms of culturally art work on route continued. As we got off the state highway we headed down towards Lake Taupo and this final bit of driving was very pretty driving along the lake until reached our second campsite, which we are staying 2 nights at. 

Motutere Bay will be our base for the next 2 nights, yet again friendly check in staff, even moved us so we were at a quieter spot....not sure what she meant!! But we are right on the lake, literally almost due to my navigating Graham reversing the camper.. so after avoiding Graham reversing into the lake we cracked open the wine and I caught up on the journal while graham cooked curry.
