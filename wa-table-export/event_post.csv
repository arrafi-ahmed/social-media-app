Team was largely meeting for the first time with so many not available for pre-season.

Real Midlands started off shaky but scored first. Camden equalised after a through ball to Tom from Will. However Real Midlands ended up dominating the whole game scoring 4 more goals to get a comfortable victory.

We shot ourselves in the foot, with three of the goals against us coming from keeper mistakes and one other from failure to clear the ball. Karim had a couple chances which he would have buried on another day, he's rustiness is understood given it was his first league game in a year and had only played 1 pre season game prior to this.
Other than that we didn't really threaten Real Midlands and the game was comfortable for them.

We started strong by scoring  early to go 1 nil up from a converted penalty by Karim. But a defensive mistake from Khalid led to an equaliser. Karim scored another goal from a Maz cross to make it 2-1. Karim took the ball down well from the cross and put it into the bottom corner with a clever finish.

From then on Camden collapse. Mistake after mistake from Camden resulted on easy goals against us.

It didn't help that we started arguing amongst each other and by second half the game plan went out the window. Birmingham Blaze goal keeper was sent off for handballing outside the area. A mistake from the ref as this isn't a red card offence. However, even with 10 men Blaze went on to score 5 more goals against us.

The game was tight and remained goaless at half time. Will and Sam worked hard as a two in midfield and as the game went on Camden started to take control. We scored first early in the second half after a great ball from Tom to Hansu and he cleverly laid it off to Badri who lobbed the keeper with a shot from outside the area.

Camden scored first but Villa Tavern got a goal back. With both sides getting plenty of chances both teams were 3 all with only a few minutes left.

We went 2 nil down in the first 15 minutes.

We started with 5 at the back but after a change of formation by putting an extra man in midfield things improved. We also realised that playing more direct to exploit their weak defence.

Karim managed to get us a goal back, then we unfortunately went 3 - 1 down. However after another change of formation in the second half going 442. We dominated the game and put the game back to 3 all after a great finish from Tom.

Wanderers did get a last minute penalty after their player tripped over his own foot. But with the last kick of the game their taker skied the penalty.

A game that Camden really should've have won. We threw away a 2 goal lead on two occasions.

Unfortunately two keeping mistakes from Adrian let them back in the game.  However all their goals came from set pieces, a couple of which was poorly defended by Camden. Likewise Manny mistake as linesman allowed a clearly offside goal to stand.

The game went to pens. Most of us scored and after 11 penalty taken it came down to the keepers to decide the game.

We started poorly with a goal conceded in first 5 minutes  when keeper misjudged a long ball and it bounced over him into the goal.

But we recovered well and after a shaky start Karim scored from a Badri through ball.

We got lucky with a Jerome goal that was offside to make it 2 - 1.

Then another piece of luck when referee gave a corner to Camden that was a goal kick. Sam scored from the preceding corner to make it 3 - 1.

Camden continued to dominate until Jerome made it 4 - 1 in second half. Beaufort made it interesting by getting one back. But Camden had several chances to score even more and remained in control for the remainder of the game.

Sam in midfield put in a man of the match performance with his energy and closing down.

From start to finish Camden dominated the game. We wanted revenge after the heavy defeat in the cup and we proved how much better we are than them.

Karim and Tom took turns scoring and assisting between themselves. With Tom scoring probably the goal of the season so far with a first time strike from 20 yards across the keeper into the top corner.

Will finished the scoring off with a tap in after a free kick from Adrian was dropped by the keeper.

Camden started off well scoring early with a goal from Tom after a great cross from Karim.

But we got sloppy and let them back into it. We took the lead again before 2nd half after another cross from Karim to Tom.

Second half started off scrappy and once again we conceded from another free kick due to us having a deep line.

Things could've been worse but an amazing point blank save from Adrian kept the score level.

But luckily we got back into the game with a great lob finish from Sam and killed the game off when the leagues top scorer Karim finished it off with his customary goal.

561,Camden vs North West Spartans,2024-11-17 00:00:00,10:30:00,12:30:00,Rowheath,"Sam Leach Memorial Cup

Probably one of the worst game of the season for Camden. Although we scored first we never really had control of the game.

First goal was an assist from Tom to Jerome. However after a mistake from one of our defenders and failure to deal with their runner they equalised. Spartans took the lead early in 1st half after Deano and David failed to communicate when going for an header which meant the ball dropped for their player to put in the bottom corner.

We managed to equalise from a Doyin header - corner from Tom.

The game went into penalties, although they missed their first after a good save from Adrian. We also missed our first. Unfortunately Deano the 5th taker missed his pen and Spartans go through to next round.

Camden never really had control of the game and in truth deserved to lose.

Started slow, went 2 nil down. We made a tactical change in midfield and things changed. Karim scored to get us to 2-1 before tom equalised and Karim scored to make it 3-2 by half time.

We came out and scored early with Karim completing his hatrick. Unfortunately Karim suffered a bad tackle and had to come off.

However, we continued with our momentum to score 2 more.

Camden suffered a temporary glitch which resulted in Villa Tavern pulling the score back to 5-3. But Camden carried on to finish the game strongly by scoring 3 more goals.

Second goal came from Sam.pressing on the defender to rob him off the ball before slotting into the bottom corner.
