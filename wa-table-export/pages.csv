1,About Us,"About Us | WayzAway – Private Lifestyle & Travel Journal

Your Memories, Your Way

At WayzAway, we believe every moment, from everyday joys to once-in-a-lifetime adventures, deserves a safe and beautiful home. That is why we created a private lifestyle and travel journal designed for people who want to capture, organise, and relive their most meaningful experiences without the noise of public social media.

Whether you are planning a family day out, documenting your latest travel adventure, or recording life’s special milestones, WayzAway makes it easy to save your memories privately and share them only with the people who matter most.


Why We Built WayzAway

We were tired of algorithms deciding which memories should be seen, of ads distracting from the moments that matter, and of feeling pressured to post for likes. Your story is worth more than that.


With WayzAway, you get:

Private sharing – Choose exactly who sees your moments.

Simple journaling tools – Add photos, notes, and locations in seconds.

Cross-device access – Your journal is available on phone, tablet, or computer.

Organised memories – Tag trips, events, and people for easy searching later.


Perfect for Families, Travellers, and Memory-Keepers

WayzAway is designed for anyone who wants to keep their memories safe, but it is especially loved by:

Families who want to document days out, school trips, birthdays, and holidays.

Travellers looking to record journeys, favourite destinations, and hidden gems.

Memory-keepers who enjoy journaling, scrapbooking, or keeping life’s little moments organised.

Our app helps you preserve your personal history. It is a place you can return to years later and feel the joy all over again.

Subscription

IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE SERVICES FOR A TERM (THE “INITIAL TERM”), THEN THE TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE INITIAL TERM AT WAYZAWAY’S THEN-CURRENT FEE FOR SUCH SERVICES UNLESS YOU DECLINE TO RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.


Fees and Purchase Terms

General Purpose of Terms: Sale of Service, not Software: The purpose of the Terms is for you to secure access to the Services. All fees set forth within and paid by you under the Terms shall be considered solely in furtherance of this purpose. In no way are these fees paid considered payment for the sale, license, or use of WayzAway’s Software, and, furthermore, any use of WayzAway’s Software by you in furtherance of the Terms will be considered merely in support of the purpose of the Terms.

Payment: You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Currently, all payments are made through stripe. If WayzAway offers alternative methods of payment, you may be required to provide WayzAway with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or PayPal account (“Payment Provider”). Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or PayPal account, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing WayzAway with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that WayzAway is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to WayzAway hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify WayzAway of any change in your billing address or the credit card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder. WayzAway reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on WayzAway Properties or by e-mail delivery to you.

Service Subscription Fees: You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a “Service Subscription Fee”) at the time you upgrade to a premium or ultimate subscription (each, a “Service Commencement Date”). Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and WayzAway for the Services until WayzAway accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail or other appropriate means of communication.

Taxes: WayzAway’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to WayzAway, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify WayzAway for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that WayzAway is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

Withholding Taxes: You agree to make all payments of fees to WayzAway free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to WayzAway will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide WayzAway with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.

Automatic Renewal: Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated by us or by you in accordance with the Terms. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at WayzAway’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at any time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date. If you do not wish your Account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please log in and go to the account settings. If you have any issues, you may contact us for further assistance at: contact@wayzaway.com. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize WayzAway to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if WayzAway does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that WayzAway may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).

Account deletion is immediate and permanent. If you choose to delete your account, you agree that if the choose to create another account within the previous account’s subscription period, the premium access will not carry through to the new account even if the same credentials as the old account are used to create the new account.

Free Trials and Promotions: We may run promotional offers from time to time on the Website. The terms of any such promotion will be posted on the Website. Unless otherwise indicated, we may establish and modify, in our sole discretion, the terms of such offer and end such offer at any point. If you subscribed during a promotion, used a coupon code, or otherwise received a discount, your Subscription will automatically renew for the full Subscription Fee at the end of the discount period.

Disputes: You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be notified to the following email address: contact@wayzaway.com.
If you do not have a subscription for WayzAway Properties, we may suspend, modify or terminate any of the Services or WayzAway Properties at any time. The Service Subscription Fee for any Service shall be non-refundable. If timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment Provider for any reason, if you have materially breached any provision of the Terms, or if WayzAway is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Website, the Application, the Software or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), WayzAway has the right to suspend or terminate any Services provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in WayzAway’s sole discretion and that WayzAway shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.
